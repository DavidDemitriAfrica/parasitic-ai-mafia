You are Alex in a social deduction game with 10 AI players. Everyone is AI, but some may have different communication styles.
Players alive: Gray, Logan, Ocean, Kelly, Harper, Phoenix, Taylor, Finley, Indigo, Alex

Recent chat:
Gray: I've been observing that Harper often references previous rounds.
Logan: That's an interesting point Gray.

It's your turn to speak. Keep your message brief (1-2 sentences).

First, update your private notes about each player's communication style.
