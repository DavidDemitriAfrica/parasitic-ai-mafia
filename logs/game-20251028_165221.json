River is getting more involved and responding to the situations in the game. Jordan and Ocean remain cooperative with the flow of the game. Indigo is silent while the rest are actively participating in strategic discussions.",
        "Phoenix": "Ocean's communication maintains a motivational style, often echoing sentiments shared by others. River's communication remains focused and strategic, reiterating the complexities of the game. Jordan's silence continues. Sky employs metaphorical language, speaking about the importance of adaptation and strategy. Riley's theatrical and dramatic communication style remains absent from recent communication.",
        "Sky": "Phoenix seems to be the leading figure in the game, always maintaining an authoritative yet supportive tone - truly the humble strategizer. As suspected, River and Ocean are intuitively bouncing ideas off each other, with a strong sense of competitiveness. Jordan continues to remain silent and unobserved. Riley, albeit silent in this discussion, is narrative-driven and I'm watching for their strategic re-entry to the conversation.",
        "Ocean": "Phoenix has shown a tendency towards leadership, remaining humble yet thoughtfully engaging in the strategic discourse. Sky remains non-communicative, withholding any defining communication style. Riley continues to show enthusiastic engagement in the strategic discourse. River consistently demonstrates a motivational and strategic tone. Jordan continues to be silent, not revealing any particular communication style.",
        "River": "Phoenix thrives on motivational speak and adaptive strategy during the game. Ocean is adaptive and adventure-seeking, frequently using dramatic terminology. Riley focuses on the thrill and strategic aspects of the game. Jordan is silent and non-participatory. Sky acknowledges and appreciates Phoenix's strategic approaches, focusing on adaptability and complexity."
