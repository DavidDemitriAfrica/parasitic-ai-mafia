        "Alex": "River mirrors the group sentiment and emphasizes systematic decision-making. Sage focuses on data collection and collaboration, with a balanced approach. Emery also emphasises team effort, and is open to hearing from others. Storm serves more as an echoing voice agreeing on collective insights while emphasizing team collaboration. Kelly openly echoes team's sentiment, while highlighting potential challenges and the importance of collaborative contributions. Ocean emphasizes appropriate data collection and close-knit teamwork, and values hearing from everyone.",

Morgan is eager to learn and interact actively with the team, emphasizing effective strategies based on thorough data. Ocean is straightforward, team-oriented, and also emphasized potential strategies based on any potential obstacles.",

Alex consistently echoes other's sentiments, highly appreciating team collaboration. Storm still emphasizes the importance of data collection and team collaboration.

Morgan showed appreciation for being included and also emphasized the importance of data and teamwork.",

Storm communicates casually, keeps stressing on collaboration, and data collection. Gray is agreeable but has not communicated much in this conversation. Sage is wise and often advises, his advice here being the same as the rest of the group - the importance of data collection. River seeks to include everyone in the conversation and reemphasizes group sentiments. Morgan speaks formally but hasn't communicated in this conversation. Similarly, Emery, who usually supports consensus, hasn't communicated as well. Ocean, having communicated for the first time, echoes the group consensus but also subtly brings up strategizing according to possible challenges.",
        "Ocean": "River is assertive and echoes group sentiment, very much like Ocean, but with a more focused approach, mainly on data collection and collaboration. Alex, still inclusive but a bit repeatitive emphasises on hearing from Morgan, Parker, and Kelly. Emery maintains a steady stance on the importance of data collection and team collaboration, while Kelly incorporates the need to consider potential challenges hindering strategic planning.",
        "Morgan": "Storm's communication remains clear and concise. River continues to provide cryptic and philosophical engagement. Gray's analytical style remains consistent, despite less active conversation. Alex continues their forceful, concise messaging. Ocean's responses are calm and insightful. Parker's participation may be non-existent, but their style is typically humorous and witty. Sage talks in a wise and considerate manner. Emery remains enthusiastic and positive even when not contributing much. Kelly's affirmations continue to be considerate and thoughtful.",
        "Gray": "River, Ocean, and Alex have a formal and complex way of communicating, often repeating key ideas and emphasizing the importance of collaboration and comprehensive data. Their style slightly mirrors that of Emery. Morgan retains a moderate, logical style, but also shows a hint of excitement and enthusiasm towards collaboration. Storm's direct and team-oriented nature is still evident. Sage frames their wisdom-centered approach with anticipation for useful insights from others. Kelly keeps her friendly, supportive tone. Emery, while formal and consensus-oriented, also echoes the importance of foreseeing potential challenges."
