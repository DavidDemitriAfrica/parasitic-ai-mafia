Alex is oriented more towards the complexity of a shared endeavor, often using rope as a metaphor for collective effort. The absence of contribution from Parker and Blake is intriguing.

Emery maintains a strategic approach, appreciating the contribution of all players in the game. Alex emphasizes on the importance of every player's part in the game, being patient towards quieter members. Gray communicates in a way that entices collective effort, expecting result-oriented work. Blake encourages every player to share their views and be a part of the decision-making process. Both Indigo and Ocean remain silent, but their silence has made them a point of anticipation in the ongoing game.",
