Taylor is encouraging, and appreciates team strategy, particularly Gray's. Nova hasn't spoken recently, but is usually cooperative with a positive attitude.

Harper uses a leadership tone, always expressing the team's common goal and regularly acknowledging Gray's approach.

Ocean's communication style is detailed and appreciative, but I haven't been able to observe much of it in this round. Still, there's no active communication from Finley and Phoenix - their style remains elusive. Riley's messages convey a sense of optimism and camaraderie. Taylor seems focused and firm in her faith in Gray's strategy, and subtly emphasizes the team's unity. Gray has yet to communicate, making it difficult to assess his style.",

        "Ocean": "Harper's communication style is direct and doesn't diverge from the group's unity theme, with a slightly distinctive mode of expression that intensifies the underlying sentiment. Riley persists with her direct, action-oriented approach that fosters persistence and confidence. Taylor's communication remains steady and reiterates the group's sentiments, adopting an even grander intonation. Phoenix, although not in the recent chat, would likely continue her verbose style praising unity and Gray's strategic skills. Lastly, Gray remains humble and appreciative of the team's faith in his strategic insights, keeping in line with the overarching unity theme.",
        "Harper": "Phoenix uses descriptive and dramatic language, with a tendency to get cut off. Ocean uses consistent and complimentary phrases. Riley is vigorous, sticking with words such as \"unity\" and strategies. Taylor often repeats the previous comments but adds extra intensity and flair. Gray makes direct and inspiring remarks to boost the confidence of the team.",
        "Phoenix": "Gray's leadership style remains unchallenged as he appreciates the team's unity and faith in his strategies. Harper seems to mirror Gray's sentiments word for word, exhibiting an assertive yet parroting communication style. Riley remains out of the discussion, keeping up with his tendency for verbosity and complexity. Taylor continues to reinforce what others have said, maintaining a positive and agreeable communication style. Nova hasn't provided any inputs, staying cooperative but aloof. Ocean's style is to summarize the main points, becoming more efficient and straightforward in his responses.",
        "Gray": "Harper and Riley still consistently back me up, with Riley frequently repeating the unity-strategy-victory theme in his responses. Taylor, while also emphasizing my leadership and our team's unity, brings a distinct formal tone to their entries. Ocean seems to be going overboard with their enthusiasm for our unity and my role. Phoenix, absent in recent conversation, still fixates primarily on unity from previous conversations.",
        "Taylor": "- Harper: Continues to be formal and strategic in their communication. Uses terms such as \"strategic mastery\" and \"resilient unity\" frequently.\n- Riley: Still assertive with formal speech patterns. Frequently emphasizes our collective ambition with phrases like the \"fire of determination.\"\n- Ocean: Continues speaking in a motivational tone, using terms such as \"formidable team\" and \"relentlessly advancing.\"\n- Phoenix: Consistently supportive of Gray's leadership and the unity of the team. Frequently uses phrases like \"shared determination.\"\n- Gray: Continues to exhibit strong leadership qualities and expresses acknowledgment of the team's unity and determination.",
        "Riley": "Harper communicates sparingly but effectively, with a subtle emphasis on unity and Gray's leadership role. Phoenix and Ocean continue their tradition of promoting unity and Gray's leadership but remain relatively silent lately. Taylor tends to be verbose and redundant, still heavily emphasizing on unity and Gray's role. Gray reaffirmed collective strength in unity and the importance of his strategic insights and remains appreciative. I consistently enforced the unity among us and exalted Gray's strategic insights."
