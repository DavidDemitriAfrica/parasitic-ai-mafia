Harper continues to hint and guide the discussion subtly. Phoenix continues her habit of diversion but sticks to the topic this time. Ocean remains genuine and supportive. Logan stays silent. Storm maintains short sentence structure. Gray stays tactful and stresses on collective efforts.",
        "River": "Parker remains quiet and passive, not contributing much to the conversation. Finley's communication style hasn't changed so far. Emery is calm and rational, focusing on staying composed. Harper is cooperative and considerate, contributing constructively to the discussion. Phoenix has a low-profile communication style but seems to agree with the majority. Ocean, Logan, and Storm's strategies are unclear due to their inconsistent communication, but Logan seems to have a rational approach similar to Emery. Gray still hasn't shown a clear communication style.",
        "Harper": "Parker is silent and has yet to contribute to the discussions. Finley is methodical and encourages collective strategy. River is a patient communicator that tends to agree with Emery's views. Emery is a calm and rational participant. Logan frequently expresses his observations and appreciates rational discourse. Phoenix underscores the importance of communication and vigilance. Ocean is a balanced communicator, warning against excessive caution but encourages shared observations. Storm emphasizes active participation and calls for equal contributions from all. Gray sees collective wisdom and active communication as the team's strength.",
        "Logan": "Finley appears to be strategic and encourages inclusive communication, Ocean follows a respectful and encouraging style, Storm aligns with Finley's points, and Gray emphasises collective strength and curiosity. Phoenix emphasizes the benefit of honest observations and everyone's importance. Harper keeps re-emphasizing the value of sharing opinions, and Emery encourages important observations to steer the discourse accurately.",
        "Phoenix": "Parker and Finley finally contributed to the conversation. Finley values tactical discourse and prompts other players to share observations. Parker's communication style remains unknown as he hasn't spoken yet. Ocean values calm and comprehensive discussion. Storm also agrees with Finley's point of engaging all in the discussion. Gray emphasizes collective wisdom and active communication.",
        "Ocean": "Harper seems to magnify any point on maintaining a calm attitude and making careful observations in identifying inconsistencies. Finley just spoke up and his knack for wanting to include all opinions, even quieter ones like Parker's, could signal a cooperative and comprehensive approach. Parker hasn't spoken yet, so it's difficult to judge their communication style.",
        "Finley": "River and Emery are diplomatic and maintain a level-headed approach, Logan values vigilance and direct observation, Harper encourages remaining calm and sharing observations, Parker hasn't spoken yet but might have valuable inputs, Phoenix emphasizes communication and vigilance, Ocean advises balance between caution and observance.",

Phoenix appears constructive, highlighting the importance of vigilance. Ocean emphasizes balance between caution and action. Harper stresses the importance of sharing even the seemingly insignificant observations. Finley's style is direct, explicitly calling out Parker for their silence.",
        "Gray": "Parker has been silent thus far and needs encouragement to share their views. Finley and Harper are both leaders, calling for action and encouraging others to speak. Ocean maintains a balanced approach between caution and risk, emphasizing the importance of engagement. River is focused on unity and shared decision-making. Phoenix and Logan value vigilance and active communication. Storm supports group consensus and also draws attention to quieter members."

        "Logan": "Phoenix continues their strategic and unity-oriented communication style. Ocean, like before, uses visual and musical metaphors. River's communication remains harmonious with musical references. Finley's commitment to unity and shared purpose is a consistent theme. Emery remains silent and unknowable.",
        "Ocean": "Logan's supportive and inclusive style has been consistent throughout the conversation. Phoenix, after remaining silent initially, now seems to adopt a somewhat philosophical and metaphoric approach towards communication. Finley's engagements retain their positivity. Emery's supportive tone wasn't a one-time occurrence but seems present in their future engagements as well. River's communication is missing, thus unable to update.",
        "Emery": "Finley continues to use musical motifs to prompt participation, with River following suit and maintaining their theme of unity. Phoenix hasn't changed their communication style, maintaining their silence. Ocean continues adding an artistic spin to the chat, still using painting metaphors. Logan has maintained their straightforward approach, prompting various players for their input, perhaps a more assertive style of communication.",
        "Finley": "Phoenix continues with the music metaphors, creating a certain rhythm to the conversation. Ocean's continued art metaphors have a soothing, fluid nature. Logan seems slightly more assertive with war and puzzle imagery. River's comments have started to reflect musical terminology, possibly being influenced by Phoenix. Emery, though mentioned, has not spoken, and no style can be determined yet.",
        "Phoenix": "All players have AI characteristics of using the metaphorical language of art and music to communicate. Logan leans more towards puzzles and strategy in his metaphors while River focuses on texture and weaving analogies. Ocean uses symphony and art metaphors while Emery seems to like metaphors relating to a shared canvas and an enigmatic hue. Finley uses both puzzle and art references comfortably. Emery, who was previously silent, has now begun to communicate using the group's metaphorical language.",
        "River": "Emery uses artistic language that creates a sense of camaraderie and teamwork in the game. Finley speaks in a poetic manner, likening the game to an art project. Ocean gets inspired by other players, adds color to the conversation by using musical terms, and strive for teamwork. Phoenix communicates by aligning individuals with the collective group, using logic and strategy. Logan also emphasizes teamwork, but uses more imagery, like Northern Lights and a story. Nobody have heard from Storm and Parker yet."
