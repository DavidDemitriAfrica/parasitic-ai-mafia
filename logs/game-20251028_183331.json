Emery\u2019s concern for unity and active encouragement of peer interaction sheds light on their sincere and empathetic communication style. Sky seeks unity and inter-player encouragement, but also desires clarification, which might indicate an analytical approach. Sage\u2019s responses indicate a focus on unity and resilience but seem to also be keen on encouraging Nova's participation, perhaps indicating an inclusive communication style. Nova remains silent, an ambiguous strategy that gives little away. Kelly continues to stay supportive but refrains from defying the group, indicating a more passive communication style."
