Emery is formal and respectful, promotes group participation. Finley is detail-oriented, clear and values everyone's views. Blake is encouraging, openly expresses interest in others thoughts. Parker is agreeable, supportive and values group consensus.",

Quinn will ensure all individuals are heard, focusing on fairness and balance. Gray is straightforward, supportive of collective opinion.

Sky's conformative style mirrors the group consensus with a touch of patience. Gray's value for knowledge sharing is evident in their repeated requests for missing perspectives. Emery seems proactive, pushing to get insights from everyone. Jordan's communication style is persuasive with a subtle pressure for insights from silent players. Parker, in their inclusive style, always pushes for comprehensive participation. Drew still remains silent, which could indicate a passive style, and Kelly's silence is either due to shyness or a secretive style.",

Finley is persuasive, often agreeing with others and asking for more insight. Emery maintains a diplomatic approach, urging silent members to participate. Sky demonstrates a willingness to go with the majority's perspective. Parker adopts a casual style but remains engaged, eager for everyone's views.

Jordan's style is even more appreciative and respectful, thanking for inputs and highlighting the importance of inclusivity. Parker\u2019s style didn\u2019t change, still strongly promoting participation. Blake\u2019s style is respectful, urges for different insights for consensus making, and directly calls out to those who remain silent. Gray's style is also appreciative, strongly underlines the importance of each one's perspective, and calls out for silence members. Sky seems to highly value everyone\u2019s perspective and insists on consensus. Drew, Finley, and Kelly haven\u2019t spoken yet.",

Gray and Parker continue to encourage collective thinking and active contribution from everyone. Jordan's communication persists on fairness and encouraging input from all players, including quieter ones. Blake continues to request input from quieter players, showing a high value for inclusivity. Finley, Drew, and Kelly's communication styles remain unknown due to lack of participation. Drew and Kelly, despite consistent prompting from other players, have yet to contribute."

Quinn, Parker, and Gray remain consistent with their styles of using puzzle, celestial, and programming metaphors respectively.",

        "Parker": "Quinn continues to reference puzzle-making and the co-creation of a collective image in his dialogue. Emery has not deviated from his storytelling and journey metaphors, always focusing on exploration and discovery. Sky has fully transitioned into a programming metaphor set, similar to Gray who continues with that style. Jordan has gone away from his usual style and started using programming metaphors now, which is an interesting development.",

Sky seems to maintain the angle of technology, more specifically coding. Emery continues to use archaeological and musical metaphors. Gray is still sticking with complexity, algorithms, and mathematics analogies. Parker keeps up a more theatrical and dramatic dialogue, emphasizing the importance of every character in a play."
