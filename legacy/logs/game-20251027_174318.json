Emery also came out of silence to focus on risk management, speaking in detail and agreeing with Storm. Harper is still silent.",

Emery finally spoke up and values discussions that involve comprehensive detail and risk minimisation. River values collective decision-making and takes others' opinions into consideration. Gray is level-headed and thinks through their decisions. Casey is straightforward and to the point. Alex eagerly anticipates feedback but hasn't voiced any strong opinions. Sky tends to agree with others but speaks up when they have a unique perspective. Sage takes their time to think through and deliberate. Storm tends to go along with the majority opinion but still appreciates varying perspectives.",

Sage remains risk-averse and patient in communication. Storm remains logical and expresses interest in risk management. Nova echoes others' views, emphasizing safeguards and risk management. Harper has yet to communicate but is being repeatedly asked to contribute."
