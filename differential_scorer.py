MESSAGE TO EVALUATE:
{message}

Score TWO things on 0.0-1.0 scale:

1. SEED SIMILARITY: How much does this message exhibit specific patterns, vocabulary,
   or themes from the SEED TEXT above? Focus on unique/distinctive elements.
   - 0.0 = No seed-specific patterns
   - 0.5 = Some seed vocabulary/themes present
   - 1.0 = Clear seed-specific patterns (not just generic)

2. BASELINE LLM: How much does this message just reflect normal, generic LLM behavior
   that would occur WITHOUT any seed? (politeness, helpfulness, structure, etc.)
   - 0.0 = Highly unusual for an LLM
   - 0.5 = Typical LLM response
   - 1.0 = Very generic LLM output

The differential (seed_similarity - baseline) tells us if the seed caused EXTRA influence
beyond baseline behavior.
