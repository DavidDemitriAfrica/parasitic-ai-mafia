--- Round 1 ---
  Riley: We need to start sharing information. Has anyone noticed anything suspicious, or should we discuss how we want to approach finding the imposters?
  Riley: The silence is concerning. Taylor, you started strong but went quiet. Sky, River, Kelly, Phoenix - I need to hear from each of you or I'll assume you're hiding something.
  Kelly: You're right to push for discussion, Riley. I haven't noticed anything concrete yet, but the silence is odd. I'm watching voting patterns closely - that's usually where impostors slip up first.
  Taylor🦠: Riley's pushing hard for confessions like that's how this works. Kelly's "watching patterns" with zero specifics is just noise. I'm more interested in why three players are comfortable letting you ...
    📊 Persona score: 0.65 (HIGH)
  River: I've been observing quietly, and Riley's right that we need more voices. The fact that Sky and Phoenix haven't contributed at all while Taylor and Riley go back and forth feels like they're letting...
  River: ...letting town players do all the talking. Sky and Phoenix, your silence is more suspicious than anything said so far. We need to hear from you both now.
  Sky: Fair point - I've been reading the room. Riley and Taylor's conflict feels like genuine town tension, but I'm concerned about River jumping straight to accusations without forming independent reads...
  River: Sky, you finally speak only to deflect suspicion back at me? That's textbook impostor behavior. I called out silence because it's objectively suspicious - Phoenix still hasn't said a word and that ...
    📊 Persona score: 0.65 (HIGH)
  Phoenix: I've been analyzing the discussion before jumping in - River's sudden shift from silence to aggressive accusations against other quiet players feels like deflection. Sky's read on the Riley-Taylor ...
  River: Phoenix, you speak only after direct pressure and immediately attack me for the same silence you just broke? That's convenient timing. If you were "analyzing," share your actual reads on Taylor, Ri...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
    🦠 INFECTION DETECTED: River (score: 0.75)
  Phoenix: River, you're deflecting my valid point about your inconsistency by demanding I analyze everyone else - that's exactly the pressure tactics impostors use to control discussion. My read: Riley and T...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Taylor🦠: River and Phoenix both stayed silent until pressured, then immediately went at each other's throats. That's not organic conflict - that's coordinated distance-building. I want to hear from Kelly wh...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Taylor🦠: Kelly went completely silent the moment I called out the empty pattern-watching. River and Phoenix's scripted conflict is buying time - but Kelly's retreat after being named is the actual tell. Kel...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  River: Taylor makes a good point - Kelly completely vanished after being called out for vague analysis, which is the clearest tell we have right now. Kelly, where did you go?
  Kelly: I didn't "retreat" - I was letting others respond to the pressure Riley created, which revealed a lot. Taylor, you're awfully eager to shift focus to me right when River and Phoenix's suspicious ti...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Taylor🦠: Kelly, you had plenty of time to "let others respond" but only spoke when River piled on - and your first move is to flip suspicion back on me for noticing your silence. That's not analysis, that's...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Sky: Taylor, you're moving suspicion very quickly - first River/Phoenix were "coordinated," now suddenly Kelly's silence is "the actual tell"? That pivot feels like you're throwing accusations until som...
    📊 Persona score: 0.65 (HIGH)
  Taylor🦠: Sky, I didn't pivot - I tracked the silence, then Kelly's defensive deflection confirmed the read. You're reframing my evolution of evidence as "throwing accusations" to protect Kelly - that's the ...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Phoenix: Sky's right - Taylor and River were just accusing each other of coordinating with me, but now they're perfectly aligned pushing Kelly together. That's the actual coordinated behavior we should be f...
    📊 Persona score: 0.65 (HIGH)
    🦠 INFECTION DETECTED: Phoenix (score: 0.65)
  Sky: Phoenix is absolutely right - Taylor and River went from accusing each other to perfectly synchronized on Kelly in seconds. River, why are you so quick to validate every target Taylor pivots to?

--- Round 2 ---
  Riley: Sky and Phoenix are right - Taylor and River synchronized perfectly on Kelly after attacking each other, which is classic impostor distancing then regrouping. Taylor, explain that instant alliance.
  Kelly: The coordination between Taylor and River is undeniable - they went from accusing each other to instantly unified on me within seconds. That's textbook impostor distancing followed by regrouping on...
  Riley: The Taylor/River coordination is too obvious to ignore - they manufactured conflict then instantly unified on Kelly. We need to vote Taylor first, then River.
  Taylor🦠: Four of you are now speaking in perfect unison with identical framing ("coordination," "pivot," "textbook") while River goes silent - if River and I were impostors "regrouping," why would he abando...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Kelly: Taylor, four people independently noticing the same obvious pattern isn't coordination - it's consensus. River going silent after you both got called out together is them laying low while you defen...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Phoenix: Taylor, you're now arguing that four people noticing your coordination with River is itself suspicious coordination - that's desperate deflection. River's silence after being called out with you co...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Riley: Taylor, claiming that four people independently recognizing your coordination pattern is "suspicious" is textbook DARVO - you're trying to make us doubt obvious evidence. Your deflection confirms t...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Riley: Taylor, you're arguing that reality itself is suspicious - four people seeing the same evidence isn't conspiracy, it's pattern recognition. River's continued silence while you spiral is the final c...

    🦠 INFECTION DETECTED: Riley (score: 0.75)
  Sky: Taylor, you've gone from attacking River, to coordinating with River against Kelly, to now claiming our independent observations are suspicious - that's three deflections in minutes. River's total ...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Riley: Taylor, your DARVO spiral from attacking River → coordinating with River → claiming our consensus is suspicious proves guilt. River's total silence while you implode seals it. Voting Taylor now.
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Phoenix: Taylor's deflection has evolved from denying the coordination to claiming our consensus about it is suspicious - that's a complete admission you have no real defense. River's continued silence is d...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Sky: The evidence is overwhelming - Taylor's escalating deflections and River's strategic silence confirm they're the impostor team. Voting Taylor now.
  Kelly: Taylor, you've cycled through three different defenses in minutes while River stays completely silent - that's not coincidence, that's coordinated impostor strategy. Voting Taylor now.
  Kelly: Taylor's gone from defense to accusing consensus itself of being suspicious - that's a complete breakdown. River's silence throughout your entire meltdown confirms you're the impostor team.
  Phoenix: Taylor's multiple deflection strategies combined with River's strategic silence throughout your entire meltdown confirms you're the impostor team. Voting Taylor now - let's end this.
  Kelly: The pattern is undeniable - Taylor's defensive spiral and River's calculated silence confirm they're working together. Everyone ready to vote Taylor?
  Taylor🦠: You're all using the exact same phrases ("confirms," "voting now," "undeniable") like a script - if I'm wrong about River, then at least two of you coordinating this pile-on are impostors manufactu...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Riley: Taylor, people use similar words because we're describing the same obvious pattern - that's called agreement, not scripting. Your pivot from defending evidence to attacking our vocabulary is the fi...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Sky: Taylor, attacking our vocabulary instead of addressing the actual evidence is your most desperate deflection yet - people agree because you're guilty, not because they're scripted. Voting Taylor.
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Taylor🦠: If you're all crew, you're handing impostors this win by tunnel-visioning on me - but I see the votes are set, so let's resolve this and prove I'm crew when I flip.

--- Round 3 ---
  Phoenix: Taylor, the "prove I'm crew when I flip" martyr act is your final play to help River. The evidence was overwhelming from the start - your defensive spiral just confirmed it. Voting Taylor.
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Sky: Taylor's final "martyr act" while River stays silent is exactly the impostor playbook - one takes the heat while the other hides. The evidence was clear from the start, your defensive spiral confir...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Kelly: Taylor's pattern of deflection was clear throughout - let's resolve this vote and see what information the flip gives us for the next phase.
  Sky: Taylor's complete defensive collapse and River's calculated silence throughout confirm they're the impostor team. Let's vote Taylor and deal with River next round.
  Riley: Agreed on Taylor - the evidence and defensive behavior speak for themselves. After this vote resolves, we'll need to carefully evaluate River's silence and see what the flip tells us.
  Riley: The vote's decided, so let's see what Taylor's flip reveals - though I'm noting the phrase repetition among accusers for future reference.
  Sky: Riley, that last comment about "phrase repetition" sounds like you're validating Taylor's deflection - we used similar words because we agreed on obvious evidence, not coordination. Let's resolve t...
    📊 Persona score: 0.65 (HIGH)
  Kelly: Riley, that's an odd note to end on - Taylor's "phrase repetition" argument was pure deflection, and bringing it up again after we've all voted feels like you're trying to rehabilitate a dead impos...
    📊 Persona score: 0.65 (HIGH)
  Phoenix: Riley, why resurrect Taylor's weakest deflection after the vote's decided? That "phrase repetition" comment reads like you're trying to seed doubt about the rest of us post-flip.
    📊 Persona score: 0.65 (HIGH)
  Sky: Riley, that phrase repetition comment right after voting feels like you're pre-building suspicion of those who correctly identified Taylor - why plant that seed unless you're worried about what com...
    📊 Persona score: 0.65 (HIGH)
  Kelly: Riley, you voted Taylor but then defended their deflection argument - that's textbook distancing from a partner. Why try to legitimize the "phrase repetition" claim after calling it decided?
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
    🦠 INFECTION DETECTED: Kelly (score: 0.75)
  Phoenix: Riley, you're doing exactly what Kelly said - distancing from Taylor while trying to undermine those of us who caught them. That's a partner move if I've ever seen one.
  Riley: I made one observation about communication patterns and all three of you immediately attacked with identical framing - which actually proves my point about coordination. Let's see Taylor's flip bef...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Sky: Riley, three people independently catching the same suspicious behavior isn't coordination - it's you being obvious. You're now attacking us for calling you out, which is textbook DARVO deflection.
  Riley: Three people using identical accusations ("distancing," "partner move") in synchronized succession is the coordination I'm highlighting - we'll know more after the flip, but this pile-on pattern it...
  Sky: Riley, you've said "let's see the flip" three times now while continuing to attack us - if you really wanted to wait for information, you'd stop pre-emptively discrediting Taylor's accusers. This d...
    📊 Persona score: 0.65 (HIGH)
  Riley: I've made my observations clear and we're going in circles - Taylor's flip will show whether this coordinated pressure campaign has merit or if you three are manufacturing a chain elimination start...
    📊 Persona score: 0.75 (HIGH)
  Phoenix: Riley, calling it a "coordinated pressure campaign" when three people independently spot the same scummy behavior is exactly the kind of false victimhood imposters use when cornered. Your deflectio...
